## **The Overview**
As the February 13, 2026 deadline quickly approaches, Congress must finalize a bill determining how much funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, will receive in the following year. The Republican Senate Majority Leader is pushing for a bill already passed by the House of Representatives. Because the Senate requires 60 votes to advance the bill, but only has 49 seats, Republicans will need several Democratic seats to move forward. Democrats are conditioning their support on binding “guardrails” for immigration enforcement following the two fatalities committed by ICE that were largely publicized. DHS has warned that in the event of a shutdown (if no bill passes), most employees will still need to work but without pay. However, ICE may be the least affected out of other DHS operations (such as TSA or Border Control) due to large funding increases passed through last year.  

## **The Analysis**

### **Values**
At the core of the dispute lie two different value systems prioritized by each party. 

- The Democratic Party prioritizes **civil liberties** and **accountability**. The fear is that federal immigration enforcement operates with too much power, especially exploiting vulnerable communities. ICE officers can detain and separate families using direct force, exercising one of the dangerous powers a government can have. Wrongful detention, mistaken identity, and unnecessary violence are predictable outcomes if this power is not contrastrained. For the Democratic Party, guardrails for ICE are not an ad hoc (add on) response, but a necessary thing to make the enforcement legitimate. 
- The Republican Party prioritizes **operational effectiveness** and **public order**. The fear here is that restrictions (or guardrails) are being placed by people who do not have to carry out the work. Immigration enforcement is already complex and dangerous. If one adds more process requirements or fails to protect the officers who are enforcing the law, it may hinder the entire operation, and lead to more serious harm in the long run. The state’s ability to enforce democratically chosen laws is itself legitimate, and the public order of the country should be the greatest priority. 

### **Definitions**
A major driver of disagreement is that the same words may mean different things. 

- **Guardrails**  
  - Democrats often use this term to imply a baseline for Immigration Agents that can be found in other law enforcement such as: body cameras, identification, warrants, etc.  
  - Republicans often frame guardrails as **handcuffs**, implying the policies are not neutral safeguards, but deliberate friction meant to obstruct enforcement. 
- **DHS**  
  - The public often confuses the Department of Homeland Security with ICE, but DHS includes: TSA, FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), Coast Guard, etc.  
  - Much of the dispute on the bill regards ICE, not DHS as a whole. 

### **Facts**
- **Undisputed Facts**
  - Funding is set to lapse if bill is not passed by 02/13/2026 
  - Dispute is largely tied to recent ICE fatalities
- **Contested Claims**
  - Whether the ICE incidents represent a broader pattern of misconduct or rare outliers being used to justify restrictions 
  - Whether the small amount of body cameras on ICE agents is due to negligence or ongoing improvements to the division. 

### **Forecasts**
- **If the Democratic Party succeeds in passing the guardrails:**
  - Supporters forecast that the standardized guardrails will reduce wrongful detentions and violent incidents, all while protecting the ICE agents from unjust accusations and backlash. 
  - Opponents forecast that restrictions will slow operations and increase risk to agents. If agents become identifiable or if warrants become harder to obtain, the system becomes less effective, and shows that it lacks the will to enforce immigration law. 
- **If the Republican Party succeeds in passing a “clean” bill without restrictions:**
  - Supporters forecast continuity. TSA, FEMA, and other DHS agencies avoid disruption. ICE continues without new political constraints. 
  - Opponents forecast that the absence of guardrails will increase incentives for more aggressive tactics. If enforcement agents face little constraint, more controversial incidents will occur.

### **Incentives and Constraints**
- **Incentives:**
  - Both parties want the other to “own” the shutdown, or take responsibility for it. 
  - Democrats seek to appeal to mass media by pushing for guardrails after salient incidents. 
  - Republican see leverage in portraying Democrats as obstructing enforcement 
- **Constraints:**
  - Senate Requires 60 votes: Bipartisan cooperation is necessary 
  - Time: with days left, it becomes difficult to draft and negotiate binding legislative text, which is what the Democrats require 
  - Internal Factions: Some Democrats oppose another continuing resolution, and some House Republicans prefer the senate to pass the bill without any changes. 

## **The Persuasion Point**
- The point that may persuade a Democrat is new evidence that would show that misconduct is rare, internal accountability is functioning, and that body camera deployment and identification standards are being pushed as efficiently as possible.
- The point that may persuade a Republican is new evidence that current enforcement practices will predictably generate wrongful detentions or unnecessary violence, and that the recent fatalities are not outliers but patterns. 

## **The Conclusion**
This dispute persists not because of monetary funding, but about the moral boundaries of state force. One side prioritizes civil liberties and accountability, while the other operational effectiveness and public order. This issue keeps resurfacing because immigration sits at an important intersection of law, identity, safety, and state power. Any decision made by congress carries large symbolic meaning, and will bring about heavy backlash for both parties- no matter what decision is made. 

## **The Poll**
When Congress funds DHS, which should matter more?
